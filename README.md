INTRODUCTION
============

*UGR Beamer Theme* is an **unofficial** Beamer theme for LaTeX slides 
specifically designed to be used by the academic community of the 
University of Granada (Spain).

Here, *unofficial* means that this theme is not officially supported by the
University of Granada (UGR), but it was instead developed by me while I was
creating the presentation slides for the defense of my PhD thesis. However, 
since I  did my PhD at the Dept. of Computer Sciences and Artificial 
Intelligence of the University of Granada, this beamer theme contains several 
adjustments specifically designed to integrate well with the corporative image 
of the UGR.

Obviously, if you are not from the University of Granada but nevertheless think
that  this theme fits well to you, just feel free to use it, it's free software! 
(although I recommend you to read the LICENSE, which basically says that the 
theme is dual-licensed under the GPLv3 and the LPPL). And of course, if you 
improve the theme somehow, please let me know it in order to merge your changes,
or at least link to your forked repository.
